## 1. Why use One Click Tuner?

The two most common methods of tuner visualization are a needle or a scrolling line, both of which represent the distance in [cents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music)) between the note being played and your target note.

Instruments create frequencies with a bit of variability.  In order for needle/line-based visualizations to not jump around too much, the activity of the needle/line is "smoothed" to make it easier to read.  This has the side effect of hiding the distribution of frequencies that occur you when you play a single note on your instrument.  **The visualization in One Click Tuner fixes this by showing the distribution of frequencies around the target**.


## 2. What instruments can be tuned by One Click Tuner?

Just about any musical instrument can be tuned with One Click Tuner.  The exceptions are instruments with low ranges like [double bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bass) (iPhone microphones poorly track low frequences) and piano (see [Railsback curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_acoustics#The_Railsback_curve)).  **One Click Tuner is perfect for:**

- Guitar
- Violin
- Viola
- Cello
- Ukulele
- Mandolin
- Banjo
- Harp
- Zither
- and more!
